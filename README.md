# Lightsaber
A short program written in the Arduino IDE for a Teensy 3.2 to allow a button press to toggle a strip of individually addressable LEDs to turn on in sequence to any color based on a given RGB value.

Also includes on and off audio .WAVS and reading of the Teensy's gyroscope for a 'hum' effect.

A powerpoint made as part of a job application with more details is available here:
